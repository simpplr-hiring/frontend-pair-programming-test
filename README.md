# Welcome to the Simpplr frontend pair programming test

This repo contains a simple CRA setup that we'll be using in the test. 

Before the call with the interviewer, please ensure the following is done:

1. Clone this repo on your machine.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies - don't use `npm`.
3. Run `yarn start` and `yarn test` to ensure everything works.
4. Open the project in your editor of choice and have a quick look through
   the repo to make sure you're familiar with the directory structure.
5. Ensure you have a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account setup and you're
   signed in. A personal account is fine.
6. Ensure screensharing works correctly on your machine.
   
Good luck!
