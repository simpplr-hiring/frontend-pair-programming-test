# Welcome to the Simpplr frontend pair programming test

This repo contains a simple CRA setup that we'll be using in the test. 

Before the call with the interviewer, please ensure the following is done:

1. Clone this repo on your machine.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies - don't use `npm`.
3. Run `yarn start` and `yarn test` to ensure everything works.
4. Open the project in your editor of choice and have a quick look through
   the repo to make sure you're familiar with the directory structure.
5. Ensure you have a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account setup and you're
   signed in. A personal account is fine.
6. Ensure screensharing works correctly on your machine.

We’ll be reviewing your:

- **React components**. The shape of props good naming, well structured, readable code.
- **Testing**. Writing accessible HTML and using React Testing Library to test that components work correctly. There’s no pressure to do TDD - work how you’d normally work.
- **Matching the designs**. Our designers expect pixel perfection in our component library; take time to use Figma to check spacing, colors etc.
- **Communication**. Talk us through your thought process, we don't want to just know what decisions you’re making but why.
   
Good luck!
